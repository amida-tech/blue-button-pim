Patient Identification and Matching based on Blue Button data

Overarching modules:


The expected result is 

input -> output.

abstracting this further:

input -> function -> output.

well, what is the input?

In terms of the input, it is the following:

1. The information about the patient.
2. The information wrt the the massive database.
3. Some instruction as to how this layer should find the object. 

If it's an upload directly from the DRE-UI, then it would not need this phase.
